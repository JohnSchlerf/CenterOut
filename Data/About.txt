Datafiles will be saved in this directory.

Every subject has both *.ana and *.mvt files. *.ana files are summary files
that are suitable for analysis, containing enough information on where the 
subject was aiming and where they ended up that one can track learning. The
*.mvt files contain the full trajectory information (hopefully at 100 Hz), 
suitable for other types of analysis (velocity, acceleration, curvature,
etc.).
